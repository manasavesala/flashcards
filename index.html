            <h3 class="js">JavaScript</h3>  
            
            <p class="bg1">an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p><br>
           
            <h3 class="vr">Variables</h3>
            <p class="bg2">an element, feature, or factor that is liable to vary or change.</p><br>
        
            <h3 class="vrm">Variable Naming Convention</h3>
            <p class="bg3">a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p><br>

            <h3 class="fun">Functions</h3>
            <p class="bg4">A declared function is "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called). In JavaScript, functions are objects, and they have both properties and methods. A function can also be defined using an expression.</p><br>
    
            <h3 class="str">Strings</h3>
            <p class="bg5">String literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from String calls in a non-constructor context (i.e., without using the new keyword) are primitive strings. JavaScript automatically converts primitives to String objects, so that it's possible to use String object methods for primitive strings.</p><br>
    
            <h3 class="alt">Alert</h3>
            <p class="bg6">Advertisements. JavaScript supports three important types of dialog boxes. These dialog boxes can be used to raise an alert, or to get confirmation on any input or to have a kind of input from the users.</p><br>
